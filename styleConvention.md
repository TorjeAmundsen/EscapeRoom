We should agree on what style we write the code in. Here is a suggestion:

1.  js code is written in camelCase, meaning the first word in a name is all lower case,
    and all following words have their first letter capitalized.
    f.eks. updateVeiw.

2.  CSS is all writen with minus inbetween words when writeing names.
    f.eks combination-lock-container.
