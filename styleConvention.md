We should agree on what style we write the code in. Here is a suggestion:

1.  JS code is written in camelCase, meaning the first word in a name is all lower case,
    and all following words have their first letter capitalized.
    f.eks. updateView.

2.  CSS is all writen with a dash inbetween words when writing names.
    f.eks combination-lock-container.

3.  I recommend every contributor installs the Prettier extension in VS Code.
    This automatically formats your code in a consistent way.
    The project includes a .prettierrc configuration file, as well as a project settings.json file,
    in order to streamline the process of getting consistent settings between contributors.
